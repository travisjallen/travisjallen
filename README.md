I'm Travis Allen.

I am currently pursing an MS degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Utah. I am in the robotics track and I am working under Dr. Jake Abbott. My research lives on the border of applied physics, applied mathematics, and mechanical engineering where I study the properties and behaviors of untethered magnetic haptic devices. 

Projects I have worked on for school, work, and pleasure can be found at my portfolio website: travisjamesallen.com

Previously I worked as a research scientist for Dr. Taylor Sparks in the University of Utah Department of Materials Science and Engineering. There my work focused on the synthesis and characterization of novel thermoelectric materials discovered by data-driven approaches.
